# Reverse-Parking-Alert-System-RPAS-
A reverse parking alert system using an ultrasonic sensor and a buzzer is a practical and cost-effective solution to assist drivers when parking in reverse. It utilizes ultrasonic distance sensors to measure the distance between the vehicle and obstacles behind it and provides audible feedback through a buzzer to help the driver park safely. In many implementations, a microcontroller like the Raspberry Pi controls the system. The microcontroller processes data from the ultrasonic sensor and activates the buzzer accordingly. 

HARDWARE & SOFWARE REQUIREMENTS	:

Hardware requirements:
1.	Raspberry Pi: You'll need a Raspberry Pi single-board computer as the central processing unit for the system. A Raspberry Pi 3 or newer model is recommended.
2.	Ultrasonic Sensors: You'll require one or more ultrasonic distance sensors (e.g., HC-SR04) for measuring distances between the vehicle and obstacles. The number of sensors depends on the desired coverage area.
3.	Buzzer: To provide audible feedback to the driver, integrate a buzzer or speaker. The sound output should be adjustable and easily distinguishable to convey proximity warnings effectively.
